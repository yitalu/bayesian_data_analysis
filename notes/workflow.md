## The workflow:
Estimand -> Estimator -> Estimate

- Estimand: a statistical goal
- Estimator: a statistical model (a machine)
- Estimate: statistical results (posterior distributions and related)



## Design models:
Assuming data-generating process (also causal inference, DAGs, testing causal implications), determing what paremeters to inference, their distributions (priors) and relationships to other parameters (based on scientific theory), simulating prior prediction.

## Update models:
Updating models with data. (not only) Three ways: grid approximation, quadratic approximation, MCMC (Monte Carlo Markov Chain)

## Evaluate models:
sampling from posterior (intervals, PI, HPDI, point estimates)Â , simulating posterior prediction (predictor residual plots, posterior prediction plots, counterfactual plots), software validation, model comparison, forecasting





## Generative simulations
Generative simulations are models that produce synthetic sample and define our estimand. Since the data is generated by our own simulation, we know what results we should to get from our estimator. See the sim_globe function in R script [tossing_globe.R](./code/tossing_globe.r).
