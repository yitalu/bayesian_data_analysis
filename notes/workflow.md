## The workflow:
Estimand -> Estimator -> Estimate

- Estimand: a statistical goal
- Estimator: a statistical model (a machine)
- Estimate: statistical results (posterior distributions and related)


## Estimand (Generative Simulations)
Generative simulations are models that produce synthetic sample and define our estimand. Since the data is generated by our own simulation, we know what results we should to get from our estimator. See the sim_globe function in R script [tossing_globe.R](../code/tossing_globe.R).


## Estimator
Build an estimator so that it produces sensible estimates, including the known inputs of our generative simulation and prior predictive distributions.


## Estimate
Now we use the data as input of our estimator to get the estimates. These include posterior distributions, their summaries (e.g., means, intervals), and inference based on them (posterior predictive distributions).





[BELOW TO BE ADDED SOMEWHERE:]

## Design models:
Assuming data-generating process (also causal inference, DAGs, testing causal implications), determing what paremeters to inference, their distributions (priors) and relationships to other parameters (based on scientific theory), simulating prior prediction.

## Update models:
Updating models with data. (not only) Three ways: grid approximation, quadratic approximation, MCMC (Monte Carlo Markov Chain)

## Evaluate models:
sampling from posterior (intervals, PI, HPDI, point estimates)Â , simulating posterior prediction (predictor residual plots, posterior prediction plots, counterfactual plots), software validation, model comparison, forecasting
