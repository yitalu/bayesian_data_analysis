## Maximum entropy distribution

A maximum entropy distribution means a distribution that could happen with the greatest number of ways. Given some constraints (e.g., continuous or discrete, count result or not, ordinal or not, bounded or not, etc.), we choose the maximum entropy distributions when modeling because they are the most likely distribution naturally.

For example, when there are only two possible outcomes of an event, the outcomes have no order (flipping a coin), and the expected number of each outcome is assumed constant, the maximum entropy distribution is the binomial distribution.
